<p>Diagram elements are placed on the diagram
by clicking anywhere in the drawing area.&nbsp; A popup will
appear with an area where the block text can be entered.</p>
<p>The possible block types are as described in the Introduction, and are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>
The 'x' and 'y' coordinates of the mouse clicks are adjusted to the nearest
multiple of 4 pixels, so a degree of grid attraction is provided.  This is the default setting, but this function can switched off if desired
(the box marked "Grid" at the top right corner of the diagram).</p>
<p>
Double-clicking or right-clicking on any object brings up a popup menu showing
operations that can be performed on it.</p>
<p>If desired, the list of block-related actions can also be brought up by clicking on 
Diagram/Block-related Actions.  
For this to work, one of the
blocks must have been selected by clicking on it - the selected block will be coloured yellow. </p>
<p>
Double-clicking on a block will bring up the block action menu, or will bring up the subnet diagram, if this has been
associated with the block.</p>
<p>
Clicking on a block
brings up a popup menu showing
operations that can be performed on it. These are listed in the Help item named Processes.</p>

 
<p>
Any of these block types can be connected by arrows - see
the section on <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Arrows</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To draw an arrow, press the button with the cursor on an element
boundary, and drag or move the cursor.&nbsp; Releasing the button results in an arrow end or a 
bend, depending on whether the cursor is touching a block 
or not. Dragging an element is also done using
any button.<br>
