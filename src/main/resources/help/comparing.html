<h1>Comparing Diagrams</h1>
</center>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p>If you click on Edit/Comparing Diagrams, with a diagram selected, you will be prompted to select another diagram file to compare against.  
You do this by clicking on the tab for another diagram - if there are no other diagrams open, you will get an error message.
Until you select the diagram to be compared against, you will see a pale blue circle on your screen, saying "waiting to compare". 
Once you have selected one, or clicked elsewhere on the diagram, this circle will disappear.</p>
<p>When you have selected one, you will see the current diagram with a number of blocks and/or arrows marked with letter codes in circles.
</p>
<p>The letter codes are as follows:
<ul><li>"A" - the block or arrow has been added</li>
<li>"D" - the arrow has been deleted</li>
<li>"G" - the block has been deleted - it will be copied temporarily to the current diagram, with the word
"ghost" below it!  The "Edit/Clear Compare Indicators" function will delete it from the current diagram</li>
<li>"C" - the block or arrow has been changed in some way</li>
<li>"M" - the block has been moved (this does not apply to arrows)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>In the case of deleted blocks in the current diagram, block(s) involved will be shown in grey, with the word "ghost" showing below it/them.</p>
